\description{
This data set contains 513 diploid samples from the forest in
  Curry County, OR, USA between 2001 and 2014. A population hierarchy
  contains the names Pop, ZONE1, and ZONE2. Pop represents years, ZONE2
  represents broad-scale watershed regions, and ZONE1 represents finer-scale
  watershed regions. The \code{other} slot contains xy coordinates for each
  sample ($xy), the population hierarchy in a data frame
  ($population_hierarchy), and the repeat motif lengths for each of the 5
  loci ($REPLEN).
